  <h1>About me!</h1>
  <div class="about">Hello, my name is Nomesy (obviously not my real name), and I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth">Perth, Western Australia</a><br>
  I've lived here most of my life, except for the 13 years between January 2001 and January 2014, when I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane">Brisbane, Queensland.</a><br>
  In years past, I have had my own personal website (now defunct), as well as a blog (no longer updated, but still around... I think), and have decided to get back into having my own website, that I have coded myself using HTML/CSS. A lot of people might ask why I choose to do it this way, when there are several platforms online (e.g. Squarespace, Wix) that will allow me to quickkly and easily build a website, with "no coding required".<br>
  <br>
  Put simply: When I first learned to build web pages in 1997/98 as part of an electronic publishing course I was doing, I loved learning about how things worked, and how text and images could be displayed on a page using code. I spent many an hour coding my own website from scratch, and learning new things, such as how to implement frames, adding hyperlinks, images, and manipulating text, in order to display it how I wanted.<br>
  <br>
  Obviously, times have changed a fair bit, and as the years went on, so did the way websites were made online. Personal web pages still existed, but there was more of a shift towards things like blogs, as well as vlogs on YouTube, were it became more common for someone to just upload a video about a particular topic, or their day to day life, and call that their contribution to the internet.<br>
  <br>
  It might sound like I am throwing shade on those who do this, however, I am not! Like a lot of other people, I enjoy content put out by many different content creators on YouTube, and have found it to be informative, as well as entertaining. I've learned a lot of hobby related skills for free from YouTube, as well as new recipes and also just general information. I am the last person who will criticise people who choose to contritube in that way.<br>
